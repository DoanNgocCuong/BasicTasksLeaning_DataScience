        "\n",
        "- **DataFrames** in PySpark are powerful, but sometimes you may want to use **SQL queries** to work with your data.\n",
        "- PySpark lets you do this by creating a **temporary SQL table** (or \"view\") from a DataFrame.\n",
        "- `createOrReplaceTempView(\"df\")` takes your DataFrame (`df`) and makes it accessible using SQL.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "### Why do you need this?\n",
        "\n",
        "If you want to use SQL queries (like `SELECT`, `GROUP BY`, etc.), you need to tell Spark where the data is. By calling this method:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "df.createOrReplaceTempView(\"df\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "You are saying, \"Hey Spark, treat this DataFrame as a table named `df`, so I can run SQL queries on it!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### How it works in your code:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Load the JSON file**:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   df = spark.read.json(\"2015-summary.json\")\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "   - You load the data into a DataFrame called `df`.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Register the DataFrame as a SQL table**:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   df.createOrReplaceTempView(\"df\")\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "   - You make the data available to SQL by giving it a name (`df`).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Run SQL on it**:\n",
        "   Now you can use SQL to query the data, like this:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   spark.sql(\"\"\"\n",
        "   SELECT DEST_COUNTRY_NAME, SUM(count) as destination_total\n",
        "   FROM df\n",
        "   GROUP BY DEST_COUNTRY_NAME\n",
        "   ORDER BY destination_total DESC\n",
        "   \"\"\")\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "   This SQL query will process the data in the `df` table just like working with a database.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### In Simple Words:\n",
        "1. Think of your DataFrame as an **Excel sheet**.\n",
        "2. `createOrReplaceTempView(\"df\")` gives this sheet a name (`df`), so Spark can run SQL commands on it.\n",
        "3. Then you write SQL queries to process your data.\n",
